# Users by Identifier Endpoint
{% apimethod post %}
/users/export/ids
{% endapimethod %}

This endpoint allows you to export data from any user profile by specifying a form of user identifier. Up to 50 `external_ids` or `user_aliases` can be included in a single request. Should you want to specify `device_id` or `email_address` only one of either identifier can be included per request.

## Request Body

`Content-Type: application/json`

```json
{
    "api_key" : (required, string) App Group REST API Key,
    // Either "external_ids," "user_aliases," "device_id," "braze_id," or "email_address" are required. Requests must specify only one.
    "external_ids" : (optional, array of string) external ids for users to export,
    "user_aliases" : (optional, array of User Alias Object) user aliases for users to export,
    "device_id" : (optional, string) device id as returned by various SDK methods such as getDeviceId,
    "braze_id" : (optional, string) Braze ID for a particular user,
    "email_address" : (optional, string) email address of a user,
    "phone" : (optional, string) phone number of a user,
    "fields_to_export" : (optional, array of string) name of user data fields to export, e.g. ['first_name', 'email', 'purchases'], defaults to all if not provided
}
```
### Fields to Export

The following is a list of valid `fields_to_export`. Using `fields_to_export` to minimize the data returned can improve response time of this API endpoint:

* `apps`
* `attributed_campaign`
* `attributed_source`
* `attributed_adgroup`
* `attributed_ad`
* `braze_id`
* `campaigns_received`
* `canvases_received`
* `cards_clicked`
* `country`
* `created_at`
* `custom_attributes`
* `custom_events`
* `devices`
* `dob`
* `email`
* `email_subscribe`
* `external_id`
* `first_name`
* `gender`
* `home_city`
* `language`
* `last_coordinates`
* `last_name`
* `phone`
* `purchases`
* `push_subscribe`
* `push_tokens`
* `random_bucket`
* `time_zone`
* `total_revenue`
* `uninstalled_at`
* `user_aliases`

Please be aware that the `/users/export/ids` endpoint will pull together the entire user profile for this user, including data such as all campaigns and canvases received, all custom events performed, all purchases made, and all custom attributes. As a result, this endpoint is slower than other REST API endpoints.

Depending on the data requested, this API endpoint may have not be able to fulfill your hourly API rate limit. If you anticipate using this endpoint regularly to export users, instead consider exporting users by segment, which is asynchronous and more optimized for larger data pulls. Documentation on that endpoint is below.

### Response

`Content-Type: application/json`

```json
{
    "message": (required, string) the status of the export, returns 'success' when completed without errors,
    "users" : (array of object) the data for each of the exported users, may be empty if no users are found,
    "invalid_user_ids" : (optional, array of string) each of the identifiers provided in the request that did not correspond to a known user
}
```

For an example of the data that is accessible via this endpoint see the example below.

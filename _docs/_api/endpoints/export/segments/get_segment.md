# Segment List Endpoint

/segments/list

This endpoint allows you to export a list of segments, each of which will include its name, Segment API Identifier, and whether it has analytics tracking enabled. The segments are returned in groups of 100 sorted by time of creation (oldest to newest by default). Archived segments are not included.

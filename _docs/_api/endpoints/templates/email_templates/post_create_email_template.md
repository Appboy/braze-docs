# Create Email Template
{% apimethod post %}
/templates/email/create
{% endapimethod %}

Use the Template REST APIs to programmatically manage the email templates that you have stored on the Braze dashboard, on the Templates & Media page. Braze provides two endpoints for creating and updating your email templates.

Users' email subscription status can be updated and retrieved via Braze using a RESTful API. You can use the API to set up bi-directional sync between Braze and other email systems or your own database. All API requests are made over HTTPS.

Use the endpoints below to create email templates on the Braze dashboard. These templates will be available on the Templates and Media page. The response from this endpoint will include a field for `email_template_id`, which can be used to update the template in subsequent API calls.

# Messaging

## Overview

The Braze messaging API provides you with two distinct options for sending messages to your users. You can provide the message contents and configuration in the API request with the `/messages/send` and `/messages/schedule` endpoints. Alternatively, you can manage the details of your message with an API-Triggered Delivery campaign in the dashboard and just control when and to whom it is sent with the `campaigns/trigger/send` and `campaigns/trigger/schedule` endpoints. The following sections will detail the request specification for both methods.

The examples below contain the URL https://rest.iad-01.braze.com, but some customers will need to use a different endpoint URL, for example, if you are hosted in Braze's EU data center or have a dedicated Braze installation. Your Success Manager will inform you if you should use a different endpoint URL.

>  Similarly to other campaigns, you can limit the number of times a particular user can receive a Messaging API campaign by configuring [re-eligibility settings][40] in the Braze Dashboard. Braze will not deliver API messages to users that haven't become re-eligible for the campaign regardless of how many API requests are sent.

##  Send Endpoints

The send endpoint allows you to send immediate, ad-hoc messages to designated users. If you are targeting a segment, a record of your request will be stored in the [Developer Console][41].

>  The `recipients` array may contain up to 50 objects, with each object containing a single `external_user_id` string and `canvas_entry_properties` object.

>  Customers using the API for server-to-server calls may need to whitelist the appropriate API URL if they're behind a firewall.

>  If you include both specific users in your API call and a target segment in the dashboard, the message will send to specifically the user profiles that are in the API call *and* qualify for the segment filters.

> Message sending endpoint responses will include the message's `dispatch_id` for reference back to the dispatch of the message. The `dispatch_id` is the id of the message dispatch (unique id for each 'transmission' sent from the Braze platform).

##  Schedule Endpoints

The schedule endpoints allow you to send messages at a designated time and modify or cancel messages that you have already scheduled.

###  Create Schedule Endpoint

The create schedule endpoint allows you to schedule a Campaign, Canvas, or other message to be sent at a designated time and provides you with an identifier to reference that message for updates. If you are targeting a segment, a record of your request will be stored in the [Developer Console][41] after all scheduled messages have been sent.

#### Schedule API Triggered Campaigns and Canvases

##### API Triggered Campaigns

Use this endpoint to trigger API Triggered Campaigns, which are created on the Dashboard and initiated via the API. You can pass in `trigger_properties` that will be templated into the message itself.

```json
POST https://YOUR_REST_API_URL/campaigns/trigger/schedule/create
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "api_key": (required, string) see App Group REST API Key,
  "campaign_id": (required, string) see Campaign Identifier,
  "send_id": (optional, string) see Send Identifier,
  // Including 'recipients' will send only to the provided user ids if they are in the campaign's segment

  // for any keys that conflict between these trigger properties and those in a Recipient Object, the value from the
  // Recipient Object will be used
  "audience": (optional, Connected Audience Object) see Connected Audience,
  // Including 'audience' will only send to users in the audience
  // If 'recipients' and 'audience' are not provided and broadcast is not set to 'false',
  // the message will send to entire segment targeted by the campaign
  "broadcast": (optional, boolean) see Broadcast -- defaults to false on 8/31/17, must be set to true if "recipients" object is omitted,
  "trigger_properties": (optional, object) personalization key-value pairs for all users in this send; see Trigger Properties,
  "schedule": {
    "time": (required, datetime as ISO 8601 string) time to send the message,
    "in_local_time": (optional, bool),
    "at_optimal_time": (optional, bool),
  }
}
```
For more information on the "broadcast" flag, see [Broadcast][42] below.

##### API Triggered Canvases

Use this endpoint to trigger API Triggered Canvases, which are created on the Dashboard and initiated via the API. You can pass in `canvas_entry_properties` that will be templated into the messages sent by the first steps of the Canvas.

```json
POST https://YOUR_REST_API_URL/canvas/trigger/schedule/create
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "api_key": (required, string) see App Group REST API Key,
  "canvas_id": (required, string) see Canvas Identifier,
  // Including 'recipients' will send only to the provided user ids if they are in the campaign's segment
  "recipients": (optional, Array of Recipient Object),
  // for any keys that conflict between these trigger properties and those in a Recipient Object, the value from the
  // Recipient Object will be used
  "audience": (optional, Connected Audience Object) see Connected Audience,
  // Including 'audience' will only send to users in the audience
  // If 'recipients' and 'audience' are not provided and broadcast is not set to 'false',
  // the message will send to entire segment targeted by the Canvas
  "broadcast": (optional, boolean) see Broadcast -- defaults to false on 8/31/17, must be set to true if "recipients" object is omitted,
  "canvas_entry_properties": (optional, object) personalization key-value pairs for the first step for all users in this send; see Trigger Properties,
  "schedule": {
    "time": (required, datetime as ISO 8601 string) time to send the message,
    "in_local_time": (optional, bool),
    "at_optimal_time": (optional, bool),
  }
}
```
For more information on the "broadcast" flag, see [Broadcast][42] below.

##### The Schedule Object

The parameters for the Campaign and Canvas schedule creation endpoints mirror those of the sending endpoint and add the `schedule` parameter, which allows you to specify when you want your targeted users to receive your message. If you include only the `time` parameter in the `schedule` object, all of your users will be messaged at that time. If you set `in_local_time` to be true, your users will receive the message at the designated date and time in their respective timezones. If `in_local_time` is true, you will get an error response if the `time` parameter has passed in your company's time zone. If you set `at_optimal_time` to be true, your users will receive the message at the designated date at the [optimal time][33] for them (regardless of the time you provide). When using local or optimal time sending, do not provide time zone designators in the value of the time parameter (e.g. just give us `"2015-02-20T13:14:47"` instead of `"2015-02-20T13:14:47-05:00"`).

The response will provide you with a `schedule_id` that you should save in case you later need to cancel or update the message you schedule:

```json
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "schedule_id" : (required, string) identifier for the scheduled message that was created
}
```

>  Customers using the API for server-to-server calls may need to whitelist the appropriate API URL if they're behind a firewall.

> Message scheduling endpoint responses will include the message's `dispatch_id` for reference back to the dispatch of the message. The `dispatch_id` is the id of the message dispatch (unique id for each 'transmission' sent from the Braze platform).

###  Update Schedule Endpoint

The update schedule endpoint allows you to change the schedule or message contents of a scheduled message you previously created.

Instance  | REST Endpoint
----------|-----------------------------------------------------------
US-01 | `https://rest.iad-01.braze.com/messages/schedule/update`
US-02 | `https://rest.iad-02.braze.com/messages/schedule/update`

US-06 | `https://rest.iad-06.braze.com/messages/schedule/update`
EU-01 | `https://rest.fra-01.braze.eu/messages/schedule/update`

#### Update Message Schedule

The messages update schedule endpoint accepts updates to either the `schedule` or `messages` parameter or both. Your request must contain at least one of those two keys.

```json
POST https://YOUR_REST_API_URL/messages/schedule/update
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "api_key": (required, string) see App Group REST API Key,
  "schedule_id": (required, string) the schedule_id to update (obtained from the response to create schedule),
  "schedule": {
    // optional, see create schedule documentation
  },
  "messages": {
    // optional, see create schedule documentation
  }
}
```

#### Update API Triggered Campaign or Canvas Schedules

US-06 | `https://rest.iad-06.braze.com/trigger/schedule/create`
EU-01 | `https://rest.fra-01.braze.eu/trigger/schedule/create`

##### API Triggered Campaigns

```json
POST https://YOUR_REST_API_URL/campaigns/trigger/schedule/update
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "api_key": (required, string) see App Group REST API Key,
  "campaign_id": (required, string) see Campaign Identifier,
  "schedule_id": (required, string) the schedule_id to update (obtained from the response to create schedule),
  "schedule": {
    // required, see create schedule documentation
  }
}
```

##### API Triggered Canvases

```json
POST https://YOUR_REST_API_URL/canvas/trigger/schedule/update
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "api_key": (required, string) see App Group REST API Key,
  "canvas_id": (required, string) see Canvas Identifier,
  "schedule_id": (required, string) the schedule_id to update (obtained from the response to create schedule),
  "schedule": {
    // required, see create schedule documentation
  }
}
```

##### Updating API Triggered Campaigns and Canvases

Any schedule will completely overwrite the one that you provided in the create schedule request or in previous update schedule requests. For example, if you originally provide `"schedule" : {"time" : "2015-02-20T13:14:47", "in_local_time" : true}` and then in your update you provide `"schedule" : {"time" : "2015-02-20T14:14:47"}`, your message will now be sent at the provided time in UTC, not in the user's local time. Scheduled triggers that are updated very close to or during the time they were supposed to be sent will be updated with best efforts, so last-second changes could be applied to all, some, or none of your targeted users.

###  Delete Schedule Endpoint

The delete schedule endpoint allows you to cancel a message that you previously scheduled before it has been sent.

#### Delete Message Schedule

  "campaign_id": (required, string) see Campaign Identifier,
  "schedule_id": (required, string) the schedule_id to delete (obtained from the response to create schedule)
}
```

Scheduled messages or triggers that are deleted very close to or during the time they were supposed to be sent will be updated with best efforts, so last-second deletions could be applied to all, some, or none of your targeted users.

## Create Send IDs For Message Send Tracking

Instance  | REST Endpoint
----------|-----------------------------------------------------------
US-01 | `https://rest.iad-01.braze.com/sends/id/create`
US-02 | `https://rest.iad-02.braze.com/sends/id/create`
US-03 | `https://rest.iad-03.braze.com/sends/id/create`
US-04 | `https://rest.iad-04.braze.com/sends/id/create`
US-06 | `https://rest.iad-06.braze.com/sends/id/create`
EU-01 | `https://rest.fra-01.braze.eu/sends/id/create`

```json
POST https://YOUR_REST_API_URL/sends/id/create
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "api_key": (required, string) see App Group REST API Key,
  "campaign_id": (required, string) see Campaign Identifier,
  "send_id": (required, string) see Send Identifier
}
```
Braze’s Send Identifier adds the ability to send messages and track message performance entirely programmatically, without campaign creation for each send. Using the Send Identifier to track and send messages is useful if you are planning to programmatically generate and send content.

The daily maximum number of custom send identifiers that can be created via this endpoint for a given app group is 100. Each send id - campaign id combination that you create will count towards your daily limit. The response headers for any valid request include the current rate limit status, see [API Limits][47]

Example response:

```json
{
  "message": "success",
  "send_id" : "example_send_id"
}
```

## Get Upcoming Scheduled Campaigns and Canvases

You can view a JSON list of upcoming and scheduled Campaigns and Canvases using the following information and parameters. The endpoint will return information about scheduled Campaigns and entry Canvases between now and the designated `end_time` specified in the request. Daily, recurring messages will only appear once with their next occurrence. Results returned in this endpoint are only for Campaigns and Canvases created and scheduled in Braze.

##  Messaging Objects & Filters

### User Alias Object

{% raw %}

The User Alias Object consists of two parts: an `alias_name` for the identifier itself, and an `alias_label` indicating the type of alias. Users can have multiple aliases with _different_ labels, but only one `alias_name` per `alias_label`.

```json
{
  "alias_name" : (required, string),
  "alias_label" : (required, string)
}
```

### Recipient Object
```json
{
  // Either "external_user_id" or "user_alias" is required. Requests must specify only one.
  "user_alias": (optional, User Alias Object) User Alias of user to receive message,
  "external_user_id": (optional, string) see External User Id,

### Connected Audience Object

A Connected Audience is a selector that identifies the audience to send the message to. It is composed of either a single Connected Audience Filter or several Connected Audience Filters in a logical expression using either "AND" or "OR" operators.

Multiple filter example:

```json
{
  "AND":
    [
      Connected Audience Filter,
      {
        "OR" :
          [
            Connected Audience Filter,
            Connected Audience Filter
          ]
      },
      Connected Audience Filter
    ]
}
```

### Connected Audience Filter

These filters are used to create a Connected Audience Object.

#### Custom Attribute Filter

This filter allows you to segment based on a user's custom attribute. These filters contain up to three fields:

```json
{
  "custom_attribute":
    {
      "custom_attribute_name": (String) the name of the custom attribute to filter on,
      "comparison": (String) one of the allowed comparisons to make against the provided value,
      "value": (String, Numeric, Boolean) the value to be compared using the provided comparison
    }
}
```

The custom attribute's type determines the comparisons that are valid for a given filter.

| Custom Attribute Type | Allowed Comparisons |
| ---------------------| --------------- |
| String | `equals`, `not_equal`, `matches_regex`, `does_not_match_regex`, `exists`, `does_not_exist` |
| Array | `includes_value`, `does_not_include_value`, `exists`, `does_not_exist` |
| Numeric | `equals`, `not_equal`, `greater_than`, `greater_than_or_equal_to`, `less_than`, `less_than_or_equal_to`, `exists`, `does_not_exist` |
| Boolean | `equals`, `does_not_equal`, `exists`, `does_not_exist` |
| Time | `less_than_x_days_ago`, `greater_than_x_days_ago`, `less_than_x_days_in_the_future`, `greater_than_x_days_in_the_future`, `after`, `before`, `exists`, `does_not_exist`

>  `value` is not required when using the `exists` or `does_not_exist` comparisons. `value` must be an ISO 8601 DateTime string when using the `before` and `after` comparisons.

Examples:

```json
{
  "custom_attribute":
    {
      "custom_attribute_name": "eye_color",
      "comparison": "equals",
      "value": "blue"
    }
}

{
  "custom_attribute":

    "value": "pizza"
  }
}

{
  "custom_attribute":

    "comparison": "less_than_x_days_ago",
    "value": 2
  }
}
```

#### Push Subscription Filter

This filter allows you to segment based on a user's push subscription status. These filters contain two fields:

{
  "push_subscription_status":
  {
    "comparison": (String) one of the two allowed comparisons listed below,
    "value": (String) one of the three allowed values listed below
  }
}
```

| Allowed Comparisons | Allowed Values |
| ---------------------| --------------- |
| `is`, `is_not` | `opted_in`, `subscribed`, `unsubscribed` |

    "value": (String) one of the three allowed values listed below
  }
}
```

| Allowed Comparisons | Allowed Values |
| ---------------------| --------------- |
| `is`, `is_not` | `opted_in`, `subscribed`, `unsubscribed` |

#### Last Used App Filter

This filter allows you to segment based on when was the last time the user used the App. These filters contain two fields:

```json
{
  "last_used_app":
  {
    "comparison": (String) one of the allowed comparisons listed below,
    "value": (String) the value to be compared using the provided comparison
  }
}
```

## Broadcast

When sending a message to a segment or campaign audience using an API endpoint, Braze requires you to explicitly define whether or not your message is a `broadcast` to a large group of users by including a `broadcast` boolean in the API call. That is, if you intend to send an API message to the entire segment that a campaign or Canvas targets, you must include `broadcast: true` in your API call. If the `broadcast` flag is not set to true and an explicit list of recipients it not provided, the API endpoint will return an error. Similarly, including `broadcast: true` and providing a recipient list will return an error. The `broadcast` flag is required to protect against accidental sends to large groups of users.

{% alert important %}
For backward-compatibility, this field is only required for API calls made for campaigns and Canvases created after August 15, 2017 that intend to send to the entire audience. It will be mandatory on August 31, 2017 for all campaigns and Canvases for API calls that intend to send to the entire audience. The behavior for API calls to deliver campaigns and canvases created prior to these dates is: if an explicit list of recipients is not provided, the message will send to the entire targeted audience of the campaign or Canvas. That is, until 8/15/17, the `broadcast` field does not have a default value, so you may wish to explicitly set `broadcast: false` in existing API calls. On 8/15/17, it will default to false for newly created Campaigns and Canvases. On 8/31/17, it will default to false for all API calls.

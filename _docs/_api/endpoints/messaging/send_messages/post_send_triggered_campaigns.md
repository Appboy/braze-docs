# Sending Campaign Messages via API Triggered Delivery
{% apimethod post %}
/campaigns/trigger/send
{% endapimethod %}

API Triggered Delivery allows you to house message content inside of the Braze dashboard while dictating when a message is sent, and to whom via your API.

The send endpoint allows you to send immediate, ad-hoc messages to designated users. If you are targeting a segment, a record of your request will be stored in the [Developer Console](https://dashboard.braze.com/app_settings/developer_console/activitylog/).

This endpoint allows you to send Campaign messages via API Triggered delivery, allowing you to decide what action should trigger the message to be sent. Please note that to send messages with this endpoint, you must have a Campaign ID, created when you build an [API Triggered Campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_campaigns/).

__Looking for the `api_key` parameter?__<br>As of May 2020, Braze has changed how we read API keys to be more secure. Now API keys must be passed as a request header, please see `YOUR_REST_API_KEY` within the __Example Request__ below.<br><br>Braze will continue to support the `api_key` being passed through the request body and URL parameters, but will eventually be sunset. Please update your API calls accordingly.

### Request Components
- [Campaign Identifier]({{site.baseurl}}/api/identifier_types/)
- [Broadcast]({{site.baseurl}}/api/parameters/#broadcast)
- [Connected Audience]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/connected_audience/)
- [Recipients]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/recipient_object/)
- [User Alias Object]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/user_alias_object/)
- [User Attributes Object]({{site.baseurl}}/api/objects_filters/user_attributes_object/)
- [API Parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/api/parameters)
<br><br>
The recipients array may contain up to 50 objects, with each object containing a single `external_user_id` string and `trigger_properties` object.
<br><br>
When `send_to_existing_only` is `true`, Braze will only send the message to existing users. When `send_to_existing_only` is `false` and a user with the given `id` does not exist, Braze will create a user with that id and attributes before sending the message.

## Response Details
Message sending endpoint responses will include the message’s `dispatch_id` for reference back to the dispatch of the message. The `dispatch_id` is the id of the message dispatch (unique id for each ‘transmission’ sent from the Braze platform). For more information on `dispatch_id` checkout out our [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/data/dispatch_id/).

## Create Send Endpoint 

__Using the Attributes Object in Campaigns__

Braze has a Messaging Object called `Attributes` that will allow you to add, create, or update attribute and values for a user before you send them an API Triggered Campaigns using the `campaign/trigger/send` endpoint as this API call will process the User Attributes object before it processes and sends the campaign. This helps minimize the risk of there being issues caused by race conditions.

{% details Click to read about the Benefits of using the Attributes Object with this Endpoint %}

When user information is sent to Braze via the `users/track` endpoint, it may occasionally take a few seconds for the user to be created in Braze's system or for the data to propagate to the user's profile.

When requests are made to the `users/track` and `messaging` endpoints at around the same time, Braze cannot guarantee that the request to the `users/track` endpoint will be processed before the request to the `messaging` endpoint. This can result in race conditions that can impact messaging: for example, a user may not yet have been created in Braze's system when a request to the `campaigns/trigger/send` endpoint is processed, resulting in the user not receiving an API-triggered push campaign.

This is especially useful when you want to guarantee that a user has been created or that new data has populated to a user's profile before a message is sent to a user.
- _For example, you might want to send an order confirmation to a customer that just registered. Because the user's email information is not yet in Braze, you'll want to make sure that Braze processes the user's email address before the order confirmation campaign is sent to them._
- _Another example is ensuring that user attributes needed for campaign segmentation are processed before the campaign is sent. You might have a segment on your API triggered campaign that references an attribute value like gender, which is provided by the user during the registration process. If the attribute isn't updated on the user's profile before the campaign segmentation is evaluated, the user will not get the campaign._

Use the Attributes Object in this endpoint to guarantee that:

- Users are created before a request to the `campaign/trigger/send` endpoint is processed.
- User attributes are updated before a request to the `campaign/trigger/send` endpoint is processed.

{% alert important %}
This attribute object will __not__ create anonymous users by user alias.
{% endalert %}

Attributes that are included in this object will be processed __before__ Braze begins to send the campaign. If the ```send_to_existing_only``` flag is set to false, and an `external_user_id` does not exist in Braze's database, Braze will create a user profile for the `external_user_id` and process the associated attributes to the user profile before Braze begins to send the campaign.

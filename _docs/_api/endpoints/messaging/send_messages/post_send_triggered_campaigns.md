# Sending Campaign Messages via API Triggered Delivery
{% apimethod post %}
/campaigns/trigger/send
{% endapimethod %}

API Triggered Delivery allows you to house message content inside of the Braze dashboard while dictating when a message is sent, and to whom via your API.

The send endpoint allows you to send immediate, ad-hoc messages to designated users. If you are targeting a segment, a record of your request will be stored in the [Developer Console](https://dashboard.braze.com/app_settings/developer_console/activitylog/).

This endpoint allows you to send Campaign messages via API Triggered delivery, allowing you to decide what action should trigger the message to be sent. Please note that to send messages with this endpoint, you must have a Campaign ID, created when you build an [API Triggered Campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_campaigns/).

  "audience": (optional, Connected Audience Object) see Connected Audience,
  // Including 'audience' will only send to users in the audience
  "recipients": (optional, array; if not provided and broadcast is not set to 'false', message will send to the entire segment targeted by the campaign) [

      "user_alias": (optional, User Alias Object) User Alias of user to receive message,

The recipients array may contain up to 50 objects, with each object containing a single `external_user_id` string and `trigger_properties` object.

### Response Details
Message sending endpoint responses will include the message’s `dispatch_id` for reference back to the dispatch of the message. The `dispatch_id` is the id of the message dispatch (unique id for each ‘transmission’ sent from the Braze platform). For more information on `dispatch_id` checkout out our [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/help/help_articles/data/dispatch_id/).

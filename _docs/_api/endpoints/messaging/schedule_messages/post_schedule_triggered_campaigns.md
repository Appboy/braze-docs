# Schedule API Triggered Campaigns
{% apimethod post %}
/campaigns/trigger/schedule/create
{% endapimethod %}

Use this endpoint to trigger API Triggered Campaigns, which are created on the Dashboard and initiated via the API. You can pass in `trigger_properties` that will be templated into the message itself.

This endpoint allows you to send Campaign messages via API Triggered delivery, allowing you to decide what action should trigger the message to be sent. Please note that to send messages with this endpoint, you must have a Campaign ID, created when you build an [API Triggered Campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/api/api_campaigns/).

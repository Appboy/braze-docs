# Email Reporting

Braze provides you with a detailed report of each of your email campaigns. Navigate to the 'Campaigns' tab on your dashboard and click on the 'Details' tab of your desired campaign. On this page, you will be able to comprehensively view and analyze the success of your campaign in an organized format.

Additionally, Braze allows you to see how successful different links are within a single email campaign. Clicking on "View Heat Map" brings up a visual view of your email that shows you where and with what frequency users are clicking on certain links.

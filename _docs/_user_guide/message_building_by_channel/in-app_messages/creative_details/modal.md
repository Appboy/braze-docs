# Modal In-App Messages

Modals appear in the center of the device's screen with a screen overlay that helps it stand out from your app in the background. These are perfect for not-so-subtly suggesting that your user take advantage of a sale or giveaway.

## Modal Viewport

## Image and Copy Behavior

Modal in-app messages are designed to fit the device at the best and most filling ratios possible, while staying true to the size and ratios of your chosen image or copy for your message.

- __All images must be less than 5MB.__
- We only accept `PNG`, `JPG`, and `GIF` file types.
- We recommend that your images be 500KB.

You should __always__ [preview and test your messages]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/testing/) on a variety of devices to ensure that the most important areas of your image and message appear as expected.

### Font Awesome

Braze supports using [Font Awesome v4.3.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/cheatsheet/) for modal in-app message icons.

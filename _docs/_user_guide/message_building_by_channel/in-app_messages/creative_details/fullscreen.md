# Full-Screen In-App Messages

Full-screen messages take up the whole screen of the device! This message type is great when you really need your user's attention, like for mandatory app updates.

## Full-Screen Viewport

On a tablet or desktop browser, a full-screen in-app message will sit in the center of the app screen as shown below.

## Image Behavior

Full-screen in-app messages (with text) will fill the entire height of a device and stay true to aspect ratio. Image only full-screen messages will fill the entire height of a device and crop horizontally (left and right sides) as needed. All full-screen in-app messages will fill the open space and status bars on "notched" devices.

- __All images must be less than 5MB.__
- We only accept `PNG`, `JPG`, and `GIF` file types.
- We recommend that your images be 500KB.

You should __always__ [preview and test your messages]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/testing/) on a variety of devices to ensure that the most important areas of your image and message appear as expected.

# About Braze Currents

Understanding the impact of your engagement strategy is critical in informing your iteration and optimization of your communications with your users. To ensure that this valuable engagement data is tightly integrated with the rest of your operations, the Braze platform tracks a wide array of event data from your integration for analysis, retargeting, and other use-cases elsewhere within your own systems.

To access this data for analysis, we recommend our Currents tool, a simple way to stream continuously updating data in a seamless circuit. Use Currents to send event data to one of [our many data partners]({{ site.baseurl }}/partners/braze_currents/integration/available_partners/) and begin using your data more intelligently sooner than you think!

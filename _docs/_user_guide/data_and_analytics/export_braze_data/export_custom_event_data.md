# Custom Event Data

The Custom Events page of the Dashboard allows you to view the occurrences of one or more custom event over time. If you view Detailed Statistics for custom events or custom events by hour, you'll have the option of also viewing the data by specific segments.

## Custom Event Storage

All User Profile data (Custom Events, Custom Attribute, Custom Data) is stored as long as those profiles are active.

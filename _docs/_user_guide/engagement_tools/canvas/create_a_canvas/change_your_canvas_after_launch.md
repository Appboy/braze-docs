There are a number of things to know if you plan to edit or add more steps to any other step in Canvas after launching:

- Users who have not yet entered the Canvas __will__ be eligible for newly created steps.
- Users who have already passed newly created steps __will__ be eligible next time they re-enter if you have allowed users to re-enter the Canvas in Canvas Entry Settings.
- Users who are currently in a Canvas, but have not reached the points where new steps are added __will__ be eligible to receive those new steps.
- You cannot edit or delete existing connections nor can you insert a step between existing connected steps once a Canvas is launched.

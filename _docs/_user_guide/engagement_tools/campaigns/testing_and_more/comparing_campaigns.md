This puts the campaign list in "Compare Mode" which allows you to select up to 10 campaigns to compare at once. Select campaigns to compare by clicking the "+" icon next to each campaign name.

Once you've selected at least two campaigns (and up to 10), click the "Compare Selected" button. The comparison table will open in a new tab on the Dashboard.

Here you will see a table with each campaign listed, with the high-level campaign metrics for each campaign. To drill down into each campaign, click the campaign name to open the details page.

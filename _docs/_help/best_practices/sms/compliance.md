# SMS Laws, Regulations, & Abuse Prevention

SMS is one of the most direct ways to reach your users and customers. Therefore, regulations must exist that prevent brands from abusing or over-using this relationship, and fines for violations could cost thousands of dollars. In this article, you'll be provided with some resources and practical guidance that will allow you to work within the bounds of regulations and laws while still communicating effectively and strategically with your customers.

This article is not intended to provide, nor may it be relied upon as providing, legal advice. The use of SMS is subject to specific legal requirements.  To ensure that you are using the SMS Services in compliance with all applicable laws, you should seek the advice of your own legal counsel.

## Considerations for Compliance

### Data and Privacy

A customer's privacy is key to a meaningful and respectful relationship. Respecting a customer's privacy and information is just another opportunity to create a bond between them and your brand. Sometimes, using marketing tools can put data and privacy last.

Luckily for you, Braze follows the guidelines of [many security regulations]({{ site.basurl }}/developer_guide/disclosures/security_qualifications/#security-qualifications), including [GDPR]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/gdpr_compliance/).

The CTIA recommends that you maintain and conspicuously display a clear and easy-to-understand privacy policy.

### Consent

Opt-in, help, and opt-out options are an absolute must when creating SMS campaigns.

The [TCPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_Consumer_Protection_Act_of_1991) (Telephone Consumer Protection Act) mandates that a business must receive "express written consent" in order to send customers messages - you can do this in a multitude of ways, including web or mobile.

Remember to comply with the [National Do Not Call Registry](https://www.donotcall.gov/).

Braze uses [Subscription Groups]({{ site.baseurl }}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/keywords/) to manage groups of users based on their level of consent.

### Spam and Cadence

Similar to email, your users or customer can experience inbox burnout. But this is only one reason not to relentlessly message your customers. You should look specifically at [Section 5 of the FTC Act to ensure compliance (in the U.S.)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/ftca.pdf).

Some spam considerations are built into SMS capabilities in general (long and short code sending limits), as well as Braze's own rate limits. However, you should still take the compliance laws into consideration when planning your campaigns.

### Content

This can be a tricky one, but when in doubt, avoid topics that involve violence, sex, drugs, tobacco, or other paraphernalia. Be wise when sending messages regarding these topics - you may still be charged for messages that are blocked by various carriers.

The [CTIA](https://www.ctia.org/) (a trade association representing the wireless communications industry in the United States) recommends that you follow S.H.A.F.T. Compliance, which defines the following topics as generally "illegal" when messaging in the United States:

- Sex
- Hate
- Alcohol
- Firearms
- Tobacco

### Scheduling

Please ensure you comply with the [TCPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_Consumer_Protection_Act_of_1991) (Telephone Consumer Protection Act), which dictates that you shouldn't send messages during late hours (see the regulation's contents for exact hours). However, you shouldn't send messages that late anyway - don't you want high engagement?

### International

Most of these best practices apply to guidelines set forth in the United States of America. If you are reaching customers outside of the US region, please research best practices and laws in those areas. It is always best practice to act in a way that adheres to the most stringent regulations, which are usually applied in the United States, Canada, and countries part of the European Union.

Better safe than sorry!

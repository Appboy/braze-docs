# About mParticle & Currents

[mParticle](https://www.mparticle.com) is a customer data platform that collects and routes information from multiple sources to a variety of other locations in your marketing stack.

To get started, find the following information from your mParticle dashboard:

-   mParticle Server to Server Key
-   mParticle Server to Server Secret

Add this information to the mParticle integration page on the dashboard, and press save.

All events sent to mParticle will include the user's `external_user_id` as the `customerid`. At this time, Braze does not send event data for users who do not have their `external_user_id` set.

mParticle's documentation is available [here](http://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/braze/feed).

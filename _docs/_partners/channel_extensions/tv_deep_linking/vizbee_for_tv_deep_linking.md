# Vizbee for Mobile-to-TV Deep-linking {#vizbee}

[Vizbee][1] enables all the smart phones and smart TVs in our homes to together behave as one seamless device for great user experiences. Vizbee also helps you leverage existing mobile app marketing channels like notifications, deep-links and emails to seamlessly acquire and engage viewership across all CTV devices (like Roku, FireTV, Samsung TV, LG TV etc.). This article will walk you through how to use Vizbee with Braze to enable mobile-to-TV deep-linking.

Vizbee, with Braze, allows you to use a single console to schedule your marketing campaigns for acquiring and retaining viewers in streaming apps on both mobile and CTV devices. With this integration you can
- Schedule a mobile notification to targeted users which on tap can result in mobile app viewership or seamlessly invoke playback on a nearby streaming device or TV.
- Schedule an email marketing campaign to targeted users which on tap can result in automatic CTV app install and sign-in of the user on a CTV device like Roku or FireTV.
There are other beneficial user acquisition and retention flows for both mobile apps + CTV apps that can be enabled with Vizbee + Braze joint integration.

## Pre-requisites

Before performing the Vizbee + Braze joint integration, ensure that you have registered your app with Vizbee and have an assigned Vizbee app id. To get registered with Vizbee, please visit [Vizbee][1].

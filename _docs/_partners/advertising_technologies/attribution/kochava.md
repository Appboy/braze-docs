# Kochava

> Kochava offers mobile attribution and analytics to help you harness your data for growth. The Kochava Audience Platform enables you to plan, target, activate, measure, and optimize your app campaigns.

Kochava and Braze power a more holistic understanding of campaigns. Kochava sends attribution data to Braze to better understand what campaigns are driving installs, in-app activity, and more.

## Integration

__Step 1: Integration Requirements__

* This integration supports iOS, Android, and Windows apps.
* Your app will need Braze's SDK and Kochava's SDK installed.
* You will need to [enable IDFA collection][13] in Braze's SDK.

__Step 2: Getting the Attribution ID__

Go to your Braze account, navigate to "Technology Partners", then "Attribution" and find the API key and REST Endpoint in the Kochava section. The API key and the REST Endpoint are used in the next step when setting up a postback in Kochava's dashboard.

__Step 3: Setting Up A Postback from Kochava__

Follow [these instructions][18] to add a postback in Kochava's dashboard. You will be prompted for the key and REST Endpoint that you found in Braze's Dashboard in Step 2. Select the __"POST"__ request when creating the PostBack Call on Kochava's dashboard.

__Step 4: Confirming the Integration__

Once Braze receives attribution data from Kochava, the status connection indicator on "Technology Partners" , then "Attribution" will change to green and a timestamp of the last successful request will be included. Note that this will not happen until we receive data about an __attributed__ install. Organic installs are ignored by our API and are not counted when determining if a successful connection was established.

Note for Android and Windows Support: If you are planning to leverage the server side integration between Braze and Kochava, you'll need to ensure that you utilize the 'Identity Link' method of the Kochava SDK to capture the 'Braze ID' for [Android][29] and [Windows][30]. Please ensure that you instrument this method to capture/pass the 'Braze ID' on SDK initialization to ensure it is available when Kochava is posting your data back to Braze via the server side integration.

## Facebook and Twitter Attribution Data

Attribution data for Facebook and Twitter campaigns is __not available through our partners__. These media sources do not permit their partners to share attribution data with third-parties and, therefore, our partners __cannot send that data to Braze__.

# In-App Message Delivery

## Trigger Types

Our in-app message product allows you to trigger in-app message display as a result of several different event types: `Any Purchase`, `Specific Purchase`, `Session Start`, `Custom Event`, `Push Click`.  Furthermore, `Specific Purchase` and `Custom Event` triggers can contain robust property filters.

{% alert important %}
Triggered in-app messages only work with custom events logged through the SDK and not through the REST APIs. Check out how to log custom events if you are working with [iOS]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/analytics/tracking_custom_events/#tracking-custom-events), [Android]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/analytics/tracking_custom_events/#tracking-custom-events), and [Web]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/analytics/tracking_custom_events/).
{% endalert %}

## Delivery Semantics

{% tabs %}
{% tab Android & FireOS %}

All in-app messages that a user is eligible for are delivered to the user's device on the session start. For more information about the SDK's session start semantics, see our [session lifecycle documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/analytics/tracking_sessions/#session-lifecycle). Upon delivery, the SDK will pre-fetch assets so that they are available immediately at trigger time, minimizing display latency.

When a trigger event has more than one eligible in-app message associated with it, only the in-app message with the highest priority will be delivered.

For in-app messages that display immediately on delivery (i.e., session start, push click) there can be some latency due to assets not being prefetched.

{% endtab %}
{% tab iOS %}

All in-app messages that a user is eligible for are delivered to the user's device on the session start. For more information about the SDK's session start semantics, see our [session lifecycle documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/analytics/tracking_sessions/#session-lifecycle). Upon delivery, the SDK will pre-fetch assets so that they are available immediately at trigger time, minimizing display latency.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Web %}

All in-app messages that a user is eligible for are automatically downloaded to the user's device/browser upon a session start event, and triggered according to the message's delivery rules. For more information about the SDK's session start semantics, see our [session lifecycle documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/analytics/tracking_sessions/#session-lifecycle).

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Minimum Time Interval Between Triggers

{% tabs %}
{% tab Android & FireOS %}

By default, we rate limit in-app messages to once every 30 seconds to ensure a quality user experience.

To override this value, set `com_appboy_trigger_action_minimum_time_interval_seconds` in your `braze.xml` via:

```xml
  <integer name="com_appboy_trigger_action_minimum_time_interval_seconds">5</integer>
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab iOS %}

By default, we rate limit in-app messages to once every 30 seconds to ensure a quality user experience.

You can override this value via the `ABKMinimumTriggerTimeIntervalKey` inside the `appboyOptions` parameter passed to `startWithApiKey:inApplication:withLaunchOptions:withAppboyOptions:`. Set the `ABKMinimumTriggerTimeIntervalKey` to the integer value you want as your minimum time in seconds between in-app messages:

{% subtabs %}
{% subtab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
// Sets the minimum trigger time interval to 5 seconds
[Appboy startWithApiKey:@"YOUR-API-KEY"
          inApplication:application
      withLaunchOptions:options
      withAppboyOptions:@{ ABKMinimumTriggerTimeIntervalKey : @(5) }];
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab swift %}

```swift
Appboy.start(withApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", in:application, withLaunchOptions:launchOptions, withAppboyOptions:[ABKMinimumTriggerTimeIntervalKey : 5])
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab Web %}

By default, we rate limit in-app messages to once every 30 seconds to ensure a quality user experience. To override this value, you can pass the `minimumIntervalBetweenTriggerActionsInSeconds` configuration option to your [`initialize`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/module-appboy.html#.initialize) function.

```js
// Sets the minimum time interval between triggered in-app messages to 5 seconds instead of the default 30
appboy.initialize('YOUR-API-KEY', { minimumIntervalBetweenTriggerActionsInSeconds: 5 })
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Manually Triggering In-App Message Display

{% tabs %}
{% tab Android & FireOS %}

The following method will manually display your in-app message.

{% subtabs %}
{% subtab JAVA %}

```java
AppboyInAppMessageManager.getInstance().addInAppMessage(inAppMessage);
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab KOTLIN %}

```kotlin
AppboyInAppMessageManager.getInstance().addInAppMessage(inAppMessage)
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab iOS %}

If you wish to display an in-app message at other times within your app, you may manually display the top-most in-app message on the stack by calling the following method:

{% subtabs %}
{% subtab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
[[Appboy sharedInstance].inAppMessageController displayNextInAppMessageWithDelegate:YOUR_IN_APP_MESSAGE_DELEGATE]
// YOUR_IN_APP_MESSAGE_DELEGATE should be replaced with your in-app message controller delegate, if you have implemented one.
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab swift %}

```swift
Appboy.sharedInstance()!.inAppMessageController.displayNextInAppMessage(with: YOUR_IN_APP_MESSAGE_DELEGATE?)
// YOUR_IN_APP_MESSAGE_DELEGATE should be replaced with your in-app message controller delegate, if you have implemented one.
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab Web %}

If you don't want your site to immediately display new in-app messages when they're triggered, you can disable automatic display and register your own display subscribers. First, find and remove the call to `appboy.display.automaticallyShowNewInAppMessages()` from within your loading snippet. Then, create your own logic to custom handle a triggered In-App Message, where you show or don't show the message:

```javascript
appboy.subscribeToInAppMessage(function(inAppMessage) {
  // Display the in-app message. You could defer display here by pushing this message to code within your own application.
  // If you don't want to use Braze's built-in display capabilities, you could alternatively pass the in-app message to your own display code here.
  
  if ( should_show_the_message_according_to_your_custom_logic ) {
      appboy.display.showInAppMessage(inAppMessage);
  } else {
      // do nothing
  }
});
```

{% alert important %}
If you don't remove `appboy.display.automaticallyShowNewInAppMessages()` from your website when also calling `appboy.display.showInAppMessage`, the message may be displayed twice.
{% endalert %}

The `inAppMessage` parameter will be an [`appboy.InAppMessage`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/ab.InAppMessage.html) subclass or an [`appboy.ControlMessage`](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/ab.ControlMessage.html) object, each of which has various lifecycle event subscription methods. See the [JSDocs](https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/latest/doc/ab.InAppMessage.html) for full documentation.

>  Only one [`Modal`]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/in_app_messaging/#modal-in-app-messages) or [`Full`]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/in_app_messaging/#full-in-app-messages) in-app message can be displayed at a given time. If you attempt to show a second Modal or Full message while one is already showing, `appboy.display.showInAppMessage` will return false, and the second message will not display.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Local In-App Messages
{% tabs %}
{% tab Android & FireOS %}

In-app messages can be created within the app and displayed locally in real-time. All customization options available on the dashboard are also available locally.  This is particularly useful for displaying messages that you wish to trigger within the app in real-time.

{% subtabs global %}
{% subtab JAVA %}

```java
// Initializes a new slideup type in-app message and specifies its message.
InAppMessageSlideup inAppMessage = new InAppMessageSlideup();
inAppMessage.setMessage("Welcome to Braze! This is a slideup in-app message.");
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab KOTLIN %}

```kotlin
// Initializes a new slideup type in-app message and specifies its message.
val inAppMessage = InAppMessageSlideup()
inAppMessage.message = "Welcome to Braze! This is a slideup in-app message."
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}

{% alert important %}
Do not display in-app messages when the soft keyboard is displayed on the screen as rendering is undefined in this circumstance.
{% endalert %}

{% endtab %}
{% tab iOS %}

#### The In-App Message Stack

##### Showing In-App Messages

When a user is eligible to receive an in-app message, the `ABKInAppMessageController` will be offered the latest in-app message off the in-app message stack. The stack only persists stored in-app messages in memory and is cleared up between app launches from suspended mode.

{% alert important %}
Do not display in-app messages when the keyboard is displayed on screen, as rendering is undefined in this circumstance.
{% endalert %}

##### Adding In-App Messages to the Stack

Users are eligible to receive an in-app message in the following situations:

- An in-app message trigger event is fired
- Session start event
- The app is opened from a push notification

Triggered in-app messages are placed on top of the stack when their trigger event is fired. If multiple in-app messages are in the stack and waiting to be displayed, Braze will display the most recently received in-app message first (last in, first out).

##### Returning In-App Messages to the Stack

A triggered in-app message can be returned back to the stack in the following situations:

- The in-app message is triggered when the app is in the background
- Another in-app message is currently visible
- The deprecated `beforeInAppMessageDisplayed:withKeyboardIsUp:` [UI delegate method](#in-app-mssage-ui-delegate) has **NOT** been implemented, and the keyboard is currently being displayed
- The `beforeInAppMessageDisplayed:` [delegate method](#in-app-message-controller-delegate) or the deprecated `beforeInAppMessageDisplayed:withKeyboardIsUp:` [UI delegate method]() returned `ABKDisplayInAppMessageLater`

##### Discarding In-App Messages

A triggered in-app message will be discarded in the following situations:

- The `beforeInAppMessageDisplayed:` [delegate method](#in-app-message-controller-delegate) or the deprecated `beforeInAppMessageDisplayed:withKeyboardIsUp:` [UI delegate method](#in-app-mssage-ui-delegate) returned `ABKDiscardInAppMessage`
- The asset (image or zip file) of the in-app message failed to download
- The in-app message is ready to be displayed but past the timeout duration
- The device orientation doesn't match the triggered in-app message's orientation
- The in-app message is a full in-app message but has no image
- The in-app message is an image-only modal in-app message but has no image

{% endtab %}
{% tab Web %}
In-app messages can also be created within your site and displayed locally in real-time.  All customization options available on the dashboard are also available locally.  This is particularly useful for displaying messages that you wish to trigger within the app in real-time. However, analytics on these locally-created messages will not be available within the Braze dashboard.

```javascript
  // Displays a slideup type in-app message.
  var message = new appboy.SlideUpMessage("Welcome to Braze! This is an in-app message.");
  message.slideFrom = appboy.InAppMessage.SlideFrom.TOP;
  appboy.display.showInAppMessage(message);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## iOS Specific 

### Real Time In-App Message Creation & Display

{% tabs local %}
{% tab iOS %}

In-app messages can also be locally created within the app and displayed via Braze. This is particularly useful for displaying messages that you wish to trigger within the app in real-time. Braze does not support analytics on in-app messages created locally.

{% subtabs global%}
{% subtab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
  ABKInAppMessageSlideup *customInAppMessage = [[ABKInAppMessageSlideup alloc] init];
  customInAppMessage.message = @"YOUR_CUSTOM_SLIDEUP_MESSAGE";
  customInAppMessage.duration = 2.5;
  customInAppMessage.extras = @{@"key" : @"value"};
  [[Appboy sharedInstance].inAppMessageController addInAppMessage:customInAppMessage];
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% subtab swift %}

```swift
  let customInAppMessage = ABKInAppMessageSlideup.init()
  customInAppMessage.message = "YOUR_CUSTOM_SLIDEUP_MESSAGE"
  customInAppMessage.duration = 2.5
  customInAppMessage.extras = ["key": "value"]
  Appboy.sharedInstance()!.inAppMessageController.add(customInAppMessage)
```

{% endsubtab %}
{% endsubtabs %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Android Specific

### Server-Side Event Triggering
{% tabs local %}
{% tab Android & FireOS %}

By default, in-app messages are triggered by custom events logged by the SDK. If you would like to trigger in-app messages by server-sent events you are also able to achieve this.

To enable this feature, a silent push is sent to the device which allows a custom push receiver to log an SDK-based event. This SDK event will subsequently trigger the user-facing in-app message.

#### Step 1: Register a Custom Broadcast Receiver to Log Custom Event

Register your custom `BroadcastReceiver` to listen for a specific silent push within your AndroidManifest.xml. For more information on how to register a custom `BroadcastReceiver` please review [Braze's push documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/push_notifications/integration/#step-1-register-your-broadcastreceiver).

#### Step 2: Create your BroadcastReceiver

Your receiver will handle the intent broadcast by the silent push and log an SDK event.

It will subclass `BroadcastReceiver` and override `onReceive()`. For a detailed example, please see our [EventBroadcastReceiver.java](https://gist.github.com/robbiematthews/1d037e2c366e523b2dda5f2e053ea2a9) in the linked list.

>  Two events will be logged for the in-app message to be delivered, one by the server and one from within your custom `BroadcastReceiver`. To ensure the same event is not duplicated, the event logged from within your `BroadcastReceiver` should be given a generic naming convention, for example, "in-app message trigger event," and not the same name as the server sent event. If this is not done segmentation and user data may be affected by duplicate events being logged for a single user action.

For further details on custom handling push receipts, opens, and key-value pairs please visit this section of our [Documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/push_notifications/integration/#step-1-register-your-broadcastreceiver).

#### Step 3: Create a Push Campaign

Create a silent push campaign that is triggered via the server sent event. For details on how to create a silent push campaign please review this section of our [User Guide][73].

![serverEventTrigger]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/serverSentPush.png %})

The push campaign must include key-value pair extras which indicate that this push campaign is sent with the intention to log an SDK custom event. This event will be used to trigger the in-app message.

![kvpConfiguration]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/kvpConfiguration.png %})

The [EventBroadcastReceiver.java](https://gist.github.com/robbiematthews/1d037e2c366e523b2dda5f2e053ea2a9) recognizes the key-value pairs and logs the appropriate SDK custom event.

Should you want to include any event properties to attach to your 'In-App Message Trigger' event, you can achieve this by passing these in the key-value pairs of the push payload. In the example above the campaign name of the subsequent in-app message has been included. Your custom `BroadcastReceiver` can then pass the value as the parameter of the event property when logging the custom event.

#### Step 4: Create an In-App Message Campaign

Create your user-visible in-app message campaign from within Braze’s dashboard. This campaign should have an Action Based delivery, and be triggered from the custom event logged from within the custom [EventBroadcastReceiver.java](https://gist.github.com/robbiematthews/1d037e2c366e523b2dda5f2e053ea2a9).

In the example below the specific in-app message to be triggered has been configured by sending the event property as part of the initial silent push.

![serverEventTrigger]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/IAMeventTrigger.png %})

> If a server sent event is logged whilst the app is not in the foreground, the event will log but the in-app message will not be displayed. Should you want the event to be delayed until the application is in the foreground, a check must be included in your custom push receiver to dismiss or delay the event until the app has entered the foreground.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Web Specific

### Exit-Intent Messages

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Web %}
Exit-intent in-app messages appear when visitors are about to navigate away from your site. They provide another opportunity to communicate important information to users, while not interrupting their experience on your site. 

To be able to send these messages, first add an exit entent library, such as [this open-source library](https://github.com/carlsednaoui/ouibounce) to your website. Then, use the code below to log 'exit intent' as a custom event. In-app message campaigns can then be created in the dashboard using 'exit intent' as the trigger custom event.

```javascript
  var _ouibounce = ouibounce(false, {
    callback: function() { appboy.logCustomEvent('exit intent'); }
  });
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

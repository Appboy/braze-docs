# Carthage Integration
You can integrate the Braze SDK using Carthage by including the following in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "Appboy/Appboy-iOS-SDK" "3.4.0"
```

Once you've synced the Braze SDK release artifacts (we support Carthage via a zip of release artifacts attached to our Github releases), integrate the `Appboy_iOS_SDK.framework` and `SDWebImage.framework` into your project. Then, in your Application delegate do:

```objc
#import <Appboy_iOS_SDK/AppboyKit.h>

...

// In `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
[Appboy startWithApiKey:@"YOUR-API-KEY"
         inApplication:application
     withLaunchOptions:launchOptions];
```

## Dependency-Free Integration
If you want to use SDWebImage and/or FLAnimatedImage in your project along with the Braze SDK, you can install a thin version of the Braze Carthage framework. To do so, include the following lines in your Cartfile:

```
binary "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/master/appboy_ios_sdk.json"
github "rs/SDWebImage"
```

## Core Only Integration
If you want to use the Core SDK without any UI components, you can install the core version of the Braze Carthage framework by including the following line in your Cartfile:

```
binary "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/master/appboy_ios_sdk_core.json"
```
